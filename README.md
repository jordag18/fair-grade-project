# Fair Grade: Compentency-Based Learning Grading Tool

## Project Summary

The Fair Grade project is a web-based grading tool designed to streamline the process of evaluating and tracking student performance in educational institutions, specifically in competency-based courses. Built using Next.js 14 and deployed on Google Cloud Run with Google Cloud MySQL as the database, the system provides a centralized platform for instructors, TAs/IAs, students, and administrators to manage courses, assessments, and skills. It aims to facilitate competency-based grading, ensure consistent skill tracking, and facilitate timely feedback to students, enhancing the overall educational experience. The system is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing for easy migration to other platforms for deployment if needed. By addressing the specific challenges faced by educators in managing grades and providing feedback, Fair Grade aims to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and transparency of the grading process.
